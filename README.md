## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
> The ground clearance and vehicle length were the non-random variables that impacted mpg the most. Surprisingly vehicle weight had a moderate impact. The highest contributor of non-random variance were the vehicle length with a p-value of 2.60e-12 and ground clearance with a p-value of 5.21e-8.
> The slope coefficients had significant non-zero values and p-values were insignificant at a level of p=0.05. As a result, the slope of the linear model is not zero and would ultimately reject the null hypothesis.
> Since the R squared and adjusted R Squared are at 0.71 abd 0.68 respectively we can safely say the model has good predictive power and stronger correlation.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
> The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Lot 3 variance was almost double the design specifications for the suspension coils (170 plus) which resulted in the Standard divaiation to be much higher than Lot 1 and Lot 2. On the other hand, Lot 1 and Lot 2 has met all design specifications with low variance.
